# Swimming After Adding Chemicals: A Quick Guide

Enjoying your time in or around the pool is an absolute must during the summer season!

As every pool owner knows, maintaining your pool's water properly and regularly is key to keeping it sparkling clean.

But what if you're all set for a swim with your family, only to realize you forgot to add the necessary chemicals the night before? Can you still take a dip, or do you have to wait until tomorrow?

If you're asking yourself, "How long do I need to wait before swimming after adding chemicals?" then keep reading.

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions before adding any chemicals to your pool. It's a good idea to test the water before diving in to ensure the levels are safe.

Different pool chemicals have varying compositions, affecting how quickly they disperse in the water. Here's what you need to know about swimming safely after adding common chemicals:

## pH Adjusters, Clarifiers, Alkalinity Balancers

Wait at least 20 minutes after using these water-balancing substances before entering the pool.

## Chlorine Shock Treatment

You can swim once the chlorine content is 5 ppm (parts per million) or less. Depending on the type and amount of shock used, this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days.

## Liquid Chlorine

Generally, give your pool at least four hours to settle after adding liquid chlorine. You can swim once the chlorine levels drop to 5 ppm or lower.

## Calcium Chloride

Wait two to four hours, or one filter cycle, after adding calcium chloride to the water before swimming.

## Algaecides

Always follow the manufacturer's instructions when using algaecides. Typically, it's safe to swim after 20 minutes of adding algaecides, but be sure to check the specific directions as some may require a longer wait time.

Following this guide will help ensure you can safely enjoy your pool after adding common chemicals. If you prefer to avoid chemicals altogether, there are natural methods to lower pH levels in your pool.
