# Exploring Chemical-Free Pools: A Revolutionary Solution

What exactly is a chemical-free pool? These pools operate without any chemicals, offering a chlorine-free and chemical-free swimming experience comparable to traditional chlorinated or saltwater pools. Before delving into the intricacies, we were skeptical about chemical-free pools due to their reliance on complex natural balancing acts.

## How Can It Fresh Water System Work?

A fresh water system comprises of three main components designed to clean and sanitize pool water effectively, ensuring safety and freshness:

### 1. Fresh Water Ioniser

Utilizing copper and silver rods, the ioniser releases ions into the water, effectively eliminating bacteria and biofilm. Silver ions are particularly effective against bacteria, while copper ions act as algaecides, resulting in clearer pools.

### 2. Fresh Water Oxidiser

Equipped with electronic oxidiser cells featuring a titanium-coated plate, this component eliminates phosphates and organic compounds, functioning without the need for chlorine or saltwater boosters.

### 3. Pulsed Magnetic Chamber (PMC)

The PMC removes scale and prevents its formation by subjecting water to a variable frequency magnetic field. This process enhances filtration efficiency and eliminates breeding grounds for bacteria.

## Reasons to Choose a Chemical-Free Pool

- **Less added Chemicals:** Enjoy a pool free from chemical additives.
- **Ideal for Sensitivities:** Perfect for individuals with sensitive skin or respiratory issues.
- **Odor-Free:** Eliminates unpleasant chemical smells, suitable for indoor pool applications.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Silver and copper ions remain active longer, reducing pump run times and energy consumption.
- **Cost Savings:** Eliminates ongoing chemical costs and purchases.
- **Ease of Installation:** Simple to install and operate, requiring minimal maintenance.
- **Prevents Staining:** Eliminates bleaching and staining of pool surroundings and swimwear.
