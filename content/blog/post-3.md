# Understand Your Pool Chemicals

Swimming pools have become a staple of leisure for people worldwide, offering more than just fun. To ensure your pool remains in top condition, it's crucial to use the right pool chemicals at the appropriate times. Here's a breakdown of various pool chemicals and their functions:

**Tip:** The ideal pH level in your pool water is 7.4 to 7.6.

## Chlorine

Chlorine is a widely used pool sanitizer effective against bacteria and microorganisms. It's available in tablet or granule form, with dosage depending on pool size and water volume.

## Stabilizer (Cyanuric Acid)

Cyanuric acid stabilizes chlorine levels, prevents algae growth, and maintains water clarity.

## Bromine

Bromine serves as an alternative pool sanitizer, gentler on the skin than chlorine, commonly used in spas.

## Pool Salt

Regular addition of salt to the pool helps maintain water cleanliness and comfort, converting to chlorine during filtration.

## pH Increaser

Used to maintain optimal pH levels (7.4 to 7.6), preventing algae growth and ensuring pool hygiene.

## pH Decreaser

Lowers water pH, enhancing its acidity to combat bacteria and algae growth.

## Hydrochloric Acid

A potent acid utilized for pool cleaning and pH adjustment.

## Algaecide

Kills or prevents algae growth, available in various types suited for different pool types.

## Pool Clarifier

Removes dirt and debris particles, enhancing filtration efficiency and water clarity.

## Flocculant

Causes particles to clump together for easy removal, aiding in water purification and filtration.

It's essential to use these chemicals as directed and choose the appropriate type for your pool to maintain its cleanliness and safety. Regular maintenance ensures your pool remains a refreshing and enjoyable retreat.
